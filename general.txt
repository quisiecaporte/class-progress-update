END OF CLASS MESSAGES=========================================================================================
Thank you for completing the course! Great job! :muscle: Good luck, and see you around! :sparkles:


As we wrap up our last day of class, I just want to say thank you so much. It’s been a honor teaching you and seeing your improvement every day. 
I know it’s difficult to grasp all the lessons, but that’s only for now. Everyone starts as a beginner and you are all capable. 
What matters is that you don’t give up and keep making the effort to improve. 
Always remember to appreciate errors, because without them, we wouldn’t know what else to improve. Right? 
So, I wish you all the best in your next class and to your future goals.

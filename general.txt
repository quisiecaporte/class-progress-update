============================ THE COMPANY ============================

In our next session, weâ€™ll have a code-along discussion where weâ€™ll create an application.
For this, weâ€™ll reuse some of the codes from our Minimart Catalog and update them using PHP OOP.

I already expect you to be familiar with:

  - Form handling (getting data from forms)

  - Functions and operators

  - HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap

This will serve as a review of PHP, but now applied with OOP concepts.
ðŸ‘‰ If you have any questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to ask!

======= ACTIONS PAGE
Actions page collects the data from the form. Inside the actions file, you can still use isset() and group multiple actions together.
However, for our code-along, I will separate each action into its own file.
For example, the register action will handle registration only.


============================ LARAVEL ============================

END OF CLASS MESSAGES=========================================================================================
Thank you for completing the course! Great job! :muscle: Good luck, and see you around! :sparkles:


As we wrap up our last day of class, I just want to say thank you so much. Itâ€™s been a honor teaching you and seeing your improvement every day. 
I know itâ€™s difficult to grasp all the lessons, but thatâ€™s only for now. Everyone starts as a beginner and you are all capable. 
What matters is that you donâ€™t give up and keep making the effort to improve. 
Always remember to appreciate errors, because without them, we wouldnâ€™t know what else to improve. Right? 
So, I wish you all the best in your next class and to your future goals.
